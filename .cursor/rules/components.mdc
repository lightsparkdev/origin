# Component Implementation

## Decision Tree

1. **Does Base UI have it?** → Wrap it (Path A/B)
2. **No Base UI equivalent?** → Build custom (Path C)

**Base UI Research**: Start at https://base-ui.com/llms.txt — full component list and docs.

## Before Writing Code

1. Deep Figma analysis — follow `figma-analysis.mdc`
2. Check Base UI for existing component or composable primitives
3. For custom: check WAI-ARIA APG for accessibility requirements
4. **Write tests first** — define expected behavior before implementation

## Rules

- Zero hardcoded values — use tokens from `_variables.scss`
- Use `@include` mixins from `_text-styles.scss` for typography
- Use `clsx` for className merging
- Use `forwardRef` with named function (not arrow)
- Use slots (`React.ReactNode` props) for nested elements
- Props spread last (consumer wins)

## Testing (TDD)

Write tests before implementation:

| Path | Tests |
|------|-------|
| A/B (wrapper) | Playwright CT only |
| C (custom) | Playwright CT (unit tests only if complex logic) |

Run: `npm run test`

## File Structure (creation order)

```
src/components/{Name}/
├── {Name}.test-stories.tsx  # 1. Test fixtures first
├── {Name}.test.tsx          # 2. Tests second
├── {Name}.tsx or parts.tsx  # 3. Implementation (make tests pass)
├── {Name}.module.scss       # 4. Styles
├── {Name}.stories.tsx       # 5. Storybook
└── index.ts                 # 6. Exports
```
