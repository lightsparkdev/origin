# Figma-Code Exceptions

Intentional deviations from Figma-to-code parity. **Do not add exceptions without explicit discussion and agreement.**

## How to use

Before "fixing" a Figma/code mismatch, check if it's listed here. If listed, the deviation is intentional.

## Exceptions

### Form inputs: Transparent background

**Applies to**: Input, Autocomplete, Combobox, Select

| Figma | Code |
|-------|------|
| `--surface-primary` fill | No background (transparent) |

**Reason**: Form inputs must blend with any surface color. Figma requires a fill for focus ring effects to render — this is a tooling limitation, not a design decision.
