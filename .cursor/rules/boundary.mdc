# Origin Boundary

Origin is the design system. Products like Grid consume it.

## This Repo

**This is the workspace you build in.** All components and tokens are created here.

- Generic, reusable components
- Design tokens and typography
- Before adding logic to a component, pause and ask: should this logic live in the primitive or in the product? Check with the user before proceeding.

## Grid Reference

Grid (`/Users/ajaymantri/dev/grid`) is a product built on Origin.

- **Read-only** — never modify Grid files from this workspace
- Use as reference for how Origin components are consumed in practice
- Learn from real usage patterns when designing component APIs
