# Origin Boundary

Origin is the design system. Products like Grid consume it.

## This Repo

- Generic, reusable components only
- Design tokens and typography
- No product-specific logic or branding

## Grid Reference

Grid (`/Users/ajaymantri/dev/grid`) is a product built on Origin.

- **Read-only** — never modify Grid files from this workspace
- Use as reference for how Origin components are consumed in practice
- Learn from real usage patterns when designing component APIs

## Decision Guide

| If you're adding... | It belongs in... |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Reusable UI pattern | Origin |
| Product-specific layout | Grid (or other product) |
| Generic interaction (button, input) | Origin |
| Business logic | Grid (or other product) |
| Design tokens | Origin |
| App-specific tokens | Grid (or other product) |

## Do Not

- Add product names, logos, or branding to Origin
- Create components that only make sense for one product
- Modify Grid files from this workspace
